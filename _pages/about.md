I'm a second-year undergraduate studying computer science at the University of Washington. I'm currently part of the [Remote Hub Lab](https://rhlab.ece.uw.edu/) Stoma team, where I work on frontend and backend development using technologies such as Flutter, AWS, and React. 

In my free time, I usually enjoy reading, [writing](https://mun-site.netlify.app/), gaming, and teaching myself new skills such as guitar and foreign languages. My favorite genres are philosophy and Asian literature, and I'm currently studying Mandarin and Japanese. For games, I like to play Civilization, and occasional games of League. I'm also interested in [Socionics](https://classicsocionics.wordpress.com/), a model for information metabolism (it's kind of like a personality type system).

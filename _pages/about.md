I'm a second-year undergraduate studying computer science at the University of Washington. I'm currently part of the [Remote Hub Lab](https://rhlab.ece.uw.edu/) woundcare team, where I work on frontend development.

In my free time, I usually enjoy doing calisthenics workouts, spending time with friends, and teaching myself languages (I'm currently studying Mandarin and Japanese).
